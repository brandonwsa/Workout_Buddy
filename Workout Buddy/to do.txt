make functionalty of CRUD to workouts app - DONE for website functionality
get it so other users cant see others workouts but their own - DONE
replace WName in workout/new with 'Workout Name:'
Make API page for workouts functionality - DONE
	See KNWON ISSUES below - FIXED
make api for workouts - DONE
make workouts forms.py
make exercise app
Get date to be autofilled in when creating exercise when coming from workout/new page or coming from workout/update page
When doing the 'add your results to an existing workout plan' on home page, make it have you either select an existing workout
	to edit and go from there to adding exercises, or have it redirect you to your workouts page where you can see
	all your workouts and select one
Should also have workout name be included in exercises table as well.
Make a visual display for user to see their exercises being added to table in exercises/new
make CRUD for exercise app
make exercisedetails app
make CRUD for exervisedetails app
Create custom API urls with slugs
Create back to home button on API page
add try excepts

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
	we are able to make a duplicate exercise with same name and date and checkbox cause of id being pk in Exercises

KNOWN ISSUES:
FIXED - when including router urls to patternurls for api functionality to be used, when clicking on a workout to view its details
	the user is directed to the api page for the workout details instead.

Can either make a new workout for each entry of your day, or select existing workout and add exercises to it.
	can order and get results by date if doing the later.


check to see if we have to add anything to urls
	added the code from django restful framework in urls.py, gotta see if we actually need some of it tho, like the serializer


exercise table example: needs to be split up in different joinable tables

FOR MONOLITHIC APPROACH, will not be doing:
+ = pk		- = fk

entities:
user(username+, email, password1, password2)
workout(WName+, Date+)
exercise(EName+, Date+, weight+, sameWeight(y/n), sets, reps, volume)

relationships:
belongs to - exercise to workout

diagram:
[workout]--N--{belongs to}--M--[exercise]

tables:
belongs to(WName+-, userName+-, EName+-, Date+-, weight+-)
exercise(EName+, Date+, weight+, sameWeight(y/n), sets, reps, volume)

Make user enter in date for their workout, then carry that data into exercises table view autofilling field with date
from corresponding workout.. Will know what workout because will be coming from creating a new a new one or a workout page


FOR MICROSERVICE APPROACH, will be using:

User app table:
UName(pk)	email				password1	password2
brandon		brandon@gmail.com		hashed		hashed
joe		joe@gmail.com			hashed		hashed

Workouts app table:
username(pk)	Date(pk)	WName
brandon		12-2-20		fullbody1
brandon		12-4-20		fullbody2
joe		12-4-20		pulls
joe		12-5-20		push
brandon		12-6-20		additional

Exercises app table:
username(fk)(pk)	Date(fk)(pk)	exercise(pk)	SameWeight(y/n)	totalVolume
brandon			12-2-20		benchpress	no		2940
brandon			12-2-20		backsquat	no		.
brandon			12-2-20		pullups		yes		.
brandon			12-2-20		hamstringcurls	yes		.
brandon			12-2-20		dragcurls	yes		.
brandon			12-2-20		facepulls	yes		1260
brandon			12-4-20		deadlift	no		.
.			.		.		.		.
joe			12-4-20		bentoverrow	no		4210
joe			12-4-20		facepulls	yes		.
joe			12-4-20		armcurls	yes		.
joe			12-4-20		latpulldowns	no		.
joe			12-4-20		deadlift	no		.


ExerciseDetails app table:
username(fk)(pk)	Date(fk)(pk)	EName(fk)(pk)	weight(pk)	setAmount	totalReps	volume
brandon			12-2-20		benchpress	110		1		10		1100
brandon			12-2-20		benchpress	115		2		16		1840
.			.		.		.		.		.		.
brandon			12-2-20		facepulls	42		3		30		1260
.			.		.		.		.		.		.
joe			12-4-20		bentoverrow	135		1		10		1350
joe			12-4-20		bentoverrow	185		1		8		1480
joe			12-4-20		bentoverrow	230		1		6		1380
.			.		.		.		.		.		.
